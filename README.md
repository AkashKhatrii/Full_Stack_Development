# TypeScript

- People realized that JavaScript is a very strong language but lacks types.
- TypeScript was introduced as a new language to add types on top of JS.
- TS is a superset of JS


**Where/How does TS run?**
1. TS never runs in the browser. Browser can only understand JS.
2. TS gets transpiled down to TS.
3. If there are any type errors, then the TS compiler will give errors, if not, it converts to JS.
4. tsc is the official TS compiler.
